# Investment Thesis

## The Asset
One of <50 TAPA TSR1-certified carriers in CEE/Balkans with 160 security-certified trailers, 25 years automotive/pharma experience, and comprehensive certification stack (ISO 9001/14001/45001/27001, GDP, TISAX).

## The Timing
Market consolidation accelerating - 12% capacity reduction from insolvencies in 2024-25, regulatory tailwinds (EURO 6), and pharma supply chain regionalization create acquisition window.

## The Opportunity
Platform for buy-and-build in high-value transport niche with 15-20% margin premium vs commodity FTL; natural consolidation target for strategic acquirer or PE roll-up.

## 7.3 Key Considerations for Transition

**Key Person Risk Analysis:**

| Role | Risk Level | Mitigation |
|------|------------|------------|
| Founder/Owner | High | Transition period, earnout structure |
| Operations Leadership | Medium | Documented processes, trained backup |
| Customer Relationships | Medium | Contracts, multi-point contacts |
| Driver Workforce | Low-Medium | Low turnover, market-rate compensation |

**Transition Considerations:**
- Ownership: Founder-controlled, clean buyout possible
- Management: Thin layer below founder, may need augmentation
- Processes: Operational but not fully documented, standardization opportunity
- Systems: TMS gap, technology investment priority
- Culture: Strong safety and customer focus, preserve during integration

**Integration Opportunities:**
- Back-office consolidation (Finance, HR, IT)
- Fleet management integration
- Procurement leverage (fuel, insurance, parts)
- Commercial cross-sell
- Technology deployment (TMS, routing optimization)
