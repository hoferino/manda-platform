# CIM Presentation Guidelines

Best practices for creating compelling Confidential Information Memorandums, synthesized from McKinsey, BCG, Bain consulting methodologies and investment banking standards.

## 1. Action Titles — The "So What" Principle

Every slide title MUST state the key takeaway as a complete sentence, not just a topic label.

### The Rule
- Titles answer "So what?" — they tell the reader what to conclude
- Executives should understand the entire argument by reading ONLY the titles
- Max 2 lines, ideally under 15 words

### Examples

| ❌ Bad (Topic Labels) | ✅ Good (Action Titles) |
|----------------------|------------------------|
| Financial Overview | Revenue Doubled While Margins Expanded to 35% |
| Market Analysis | $4.2B Market Growing 18% Creates Expansion Runway |
| Customer Metrics | 95% Retention Proves Product-Market Fit |
| Management Team | Leadership Team Brings 80+ Years of Industry Experience |
| Growth Strategy | Three Proven Levers Can Double Revenue in 24 Months |
| Competitive Position | Proprietary Technology Creates 18-Month Moat |

### The Skimmability Test
A reader should be able to flip through the CIM reading only titles and understand:
1. Why this company is valuable
2. What makes it special
3. Why now is the right time to acquire

---

## 2. Pyramid Principle (Barbara Minto)

Structure all content with the conclusion first, then supporting evidence.

### The Formula
```
KEY MESSAGE (the answer/conclusion)
    ↓
SUPPORTING ARGUMENTS (2-3 main points)
    ↓
DATA/EVIDENCE (facts that prove each point)
```

### Application to CIM Slides

**Executive Summary Example:**
```
Title: CloudTech Is the Market Leader in Enterprise API Management

Key Message: CloudTech dominates a growing market with sticky customers and proven unit economics.

Supporting Arguments:
1. #1 market position in $4.2B market growing 18% CAGR
2. 95% gross retention with 125% net revenue retention
3. 4.2x LTV/CAC with 12-month payback

Evidence: [Charts and metrics supporting each point]
```

### MECE Principle
All supporting arguments should be:
- **Mutually Exclusive**: No overlap between points
- **Collectively Exhaustive**: Together they fully support the key message

---

## 3. SCR Framework (Situation-Complication-Resolution)

Use this narrative structure for the overall CIM flow and individual sections.

| Component | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Situation** | Establish context (facts audience agrees with) | "Enterprise API usage grew 300% in 5 years as companies adopt microservices" |
| **Complication** | Create urgency (the problem/challenge) | "Most solutions are fragmented, lack security, and can't scale" |
| **Resolution** | Provide solution (the company) | "CloudTech built the only unified platform that solves all three" |

### Where to Apply SCR
- Executive Summary (the hook)
- Market Opportunity section
- Individual product/service descriptions
- Growth strategy narratives

---

## 4. Slide Structure

Every slide follows a consistent three-part structure:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ACTION TITLE                               │
│  (Key takeaway as a complete sentence)      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                             │
│  BODY                                       │
│  (Charts, visuals, minimal supporting text) │
│                                             │
│                                             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  FOOTER (sources, citations if needed)      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### One Message Per Slide
- Each slide conveys exactly ONE key insight
- If you need to make multiple points, use multiple slides
- The title IS the message; the body provides proof

---

## 5. Visual Hierarchy

Guide the reader's eye to what matters most.

### Hierarchy Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Size & Scale** | Larger elements = more important. Key metrics should be the biggest text on the slide. |
| **Color & Contrast** | Use ONE accent color for emphasis. Don't rainbow the data. |
| **White Space** | "Tall buildings need parks." Give elements room to breathe. |
| **Positioning** | Top-left gets read first. Place key message there. |

### The 6-7 Element Rule
- Maximum 6-7 distinct visual elements per slide
- More than that creates cognitive overload
- Count: charts, text blocks, images, callouts, logos

### Text Density Guidelines
- **Titles**: Max 15 words, one line preferred
- **Body text**: Terse phrases, not full sentences
- **Bullet points**: 3-5 max per slide
- **Let visuals dominate**: Charts and images should be 60%+ of body area

---

## 6. Data Visualization

Choose the right chart for the insight you're conveying.

### Chart Type Selection

| Chart Type | Use When | Example Insight |
|------------|----------|-----------------|
| **Line Chart** | Showing trends over time | "Revenue grew 45% CAGR over 3 years" |
| **Bar Chart** | Comparing quantities across categories | "We outperform competitors on 4 key metrics" |
| **Stacked Bar** | Showing composition AND comparison | "Revenue mix shifted from services to SaaS" |
| **Pie/Donut** | Showing proportions of a whole (max 5 segments) | "SaaS is now 70% of total revenue" |
| **Waterfall** | Showing how values build or break down | "How we grew from $5M to $12M ARR" |
| **Scatter** | Showing relationships between variables | "Higher NPS correlates with lower churn" |

### Data Visualization Rules
1. **Highlight the insight, not raw data** — Use callouts, color, annotations
2. **Start Y-axis at zero** for bar charts (avoid misleading scales)
3. **Label directly** — Put labels on data points, not in legends
4. **Remove chart junk** — No 3D effects, gridlines, or decorative elements

### CRITICAL: Financial Data Integrity
- **Only use provided financial data** — NEVER assume or generate numbers
- If you have 2 years of revenue data, show 2 years
- Don't extrapolate or project unless the user explicitly provides projections
- Missing data should be noted, not invented

---

## 7. CIM-Specific Conventions

### Executive Summary Best Practices

The Executive Summary is often the ONLY page many PE buyers read. It must:

1. **Be self-contained** — Complete investment thesis, not just an intro
2. **Hook immediately** — Lead with the most compelling fact
3. **Cover 5 elements**:
   - Future potential (growth trajectory)
   - Strong fundamentals (proven metrics)
   - Competitive advantage (moat/differentiation)
   - Experienced leadership (team credibility)
   - Risk mitigation (address obvious concerns)

### Investment Highlights Framing
Frame metrics in terms of buyer value:

| ❌ Company-Centric | ✅ Buyer-Centric |
|-------------------|------------------|
| "We have 500 customers" | "500 enterprise customers provide $8M recurring revenue" |
| "Founded in 2018" | "6-year track record proves durability" |
| "We use AI" | "AI-powered automation reduces customer CAC by 40%" |

### Section Flow
While sections are user-driven, a typical compelling order:

1. **Executive Summary** — The complete hook
2. **Investment Thesis** — Why buy, why now
3. **Business Overview** — What the company does
4. **Market Opportunity** — Size and growth
5. **Products & Services** — How they win
6. **Financial Performance** — Proof it works
7. **Management Team** — Who delivers
8. **Growth Strategy** — Upside potential
9. **Risk Factors** — Honest assessment (optional)
