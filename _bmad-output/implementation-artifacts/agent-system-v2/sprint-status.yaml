# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic not yet started
#   - in-progress: Epic actively being worked on
#   - done: All stories in epic completed
#   - deprecated: Epic no longer needed (superseded or scope changed)
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - ready-for-dev: Story file created, ready for development
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Implementation complete, ready for review
#   - done: Story completed
#   - deprecated: Story no longer needed (Graphiti handles automatically, etc.)
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - done: Retrospective has been completed
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Mark epic as 'in-progress' when starting work on its first story
# - SM typically creates next story ONLY after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', then Dev runs code-review (fresh context, ideally different LLM)
#
# CHANGE LOG:
# ===========
# 2026-01-17: SCP-2026-01-16 applied

#   - Story 7-0 added (prerequisite for conversation search)
#   - Stories 5-5, 7-3, 8-2, 10-1, 11-3, 11-4, 11-5 updated for Graphiti architecture

  #
  # DECISION (2026-01-11): Context Loader Middleware DEFERRED
  # ---------------------------------------------------------
  # We built a "context-loader middleware" that pre-loads deal metadata before
  # every agent invocation. After review, we decided NOT to use it because:
  # 1. Not real LangGraph middleware - just a pre-invoke function
  # 2. Premature optimization - runs on every message, even "hello"
  # 3. Wrong data - loads cosmetic metadata, not useful M&A intelligence
  # 4. API route already validates deal access via RLS (sufficient)
  # 5. Another point of failure with unclear benefit
  #
  # COMPLETED: 2026-01-11 (core stories done, 3-4 and 3-5 intentionally deferred)
  #
  # ACTION ITEMS (Epic 3 Retro):
  # [x] 1. Wire retrieval node - ALREADY WIRED (graph.ts: START → retrieval → supervisor)
  # [x] 2. Delete context-loader middleware - DELETED 2026-01-11 (dead code removed)
  # [ ] 3. Max's manual testing with real deal queries - PENDING
  #
  # Note: Context-loader middleware was DELETED per retro decision. Deal context
  # is now passed via createInitialState() and used by retrieval node directly.

  # FRs: FR37, FR38, FR39, FR40
  #
  # DEPRECATED (2026-01-17): CIM MVP is production-ready
  # ----------------------------------------------------
  # The standalone CIM MVP implementation (lib/agent/cim-mvp/) is production-ready
  # with 6 fix stories completed on 2026-01-14. V2 integration provides no user value
  # since CIM MVP already delivers full functionality including:
  # - 7-stage workflow with HITL checkpoints
  # - Knowledge toggle (JSON/Graphiti modes)
  # - Dynamic KG pipeline for context-aware retrieval
  # - Prompt caching (60% cost reduction)
  # - 50+ component rendering support
  #
  # See: docs/cim-mvp/README.md for current implementation
  # See: docs/sprint-artifacts/sprint-change-proposal-2026-01-16.md

  # REDESIGNED (2026-01-17): Graphiti handles extraction automatically
  # ------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Original stories assumed manual fact extraction pipeline. Graphiti's

  # Stories 11-3, 11-4, 11-5 UPDATED - Use Graphiti patterns
  # Story 11-6 UNCHANGED - UI still needed

  # Net impact: 31 → 18 story points (-13 points)
