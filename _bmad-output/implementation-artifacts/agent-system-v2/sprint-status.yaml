# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic not yet started
#   - in-progress: Epic actively being worked on
#   - done: All stories in epic completed
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - ready-for-dev: Story file created, ready for development
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Implementation complete, ready for review
#   - done: Story completed
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - done: Retrospective has been completed
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Mark epic as 'in-progress' when starting work on its first story
# - SM typically creates next story ONLY after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', then Dev runs code-review (fresh context, ideally different LLM)

  #
  # DECISION (2026-01-11): Context Loader Middleware DEFERRED
  # ---------------------------------------------------------
  # We built a "context-loader middleware" that pre-loads deal metadata before
  # every agent invocation. After review, we decided NOT to use it because:
  # 1. Not real LangGraph middleware - just a pre-invoke function
  # 2. Premature optimization - runs on every message, even "hello"
  # 3. Wrong data - loads cosmetic metadata, not useful M&A intelligence
  # 4. API route already validates deal access via RLS (sufficient)
  # 5. Another point of failure with unclear benefit
  #
  # COMPLETED: 2026-01-11 (core stories done, 3-4 and 3-5 intentionally deferred)
  #
  # ACTION ITEMS (Epic 3 Retro):
  # [x] 1. Wire retrieval node - ALREADY WIRED (graph.ts: START → retrieval → supervisor)
  # [x] 2. Delete context-loader middleware - DELETED 2026-01-11 (dead code removed)
  # [ ] 3. Max's manual testing with real deal queries - PENDING
  #
  # Note: Context-loader middleware was DELETED per retro decision. Deal context
  # is now passed via createInitialState() and used by retrieval node directly.
