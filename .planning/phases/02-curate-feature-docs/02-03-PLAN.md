<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update cim-builder README with current/historical classification</name>
  <files>docs/features/cim-builder/README.md</files>
  <action>
Update `docs/features/cim-builder/README.md` to replace the placeholder with actual content:

1. Keep the existing Overview, Implementation, Workflow Stages, and Status sections
2. Replace the "Documentation" section placeholder with:

## Documentation

### Current (Authoritative)

| Document | Description | Last Updated |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| [CIM MVP Hub](../../cim-mvp/README.md) | Primary documentation hub for CIM MVP | 2026-01-15 |
| CLAUDE.md | Implementation patterns and anti-patterns | Current |

The CIM MVP Hub contains:
- Implementation status and component locations
- Workflow stages (7 stages from welcome to complete)
- SSE event types
- Testing artifacts

### Historical (Planning Reference)

These documents capture planning and decision-making:

| Document | Purpose | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| [Architecture Evaluation](../../../_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/cim-builder-architecture-evaluation.md) | Framework decision: LangGraph + Claude | 2026-01-14 |
| [Subgraph Analysis](../../../_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/cim-subgraph-architecture.md) | Technical analysis for future v2 integration | Reference for Story 6.1 |
| [Caching Fix Plan](../../../_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/cim-mvp-caching-fix-plan.md) | Prompt caching optimization | Implemented |

### Superseded

| Document | Superseded By |
|----------|---------------|
| `lib/agent/cim/` | Original CIM implementation, superseded by `cim-mvp` |

### Future Work

**Story 6.1: CIM v2 Integration** - The CIM MVP currently runs as a standalone workflow. Future integration into the v2 agent system is planned but not scheduled.

3. Add a "Key Files" section before the "Back to" link:

## Key Files

```
manda-app/lib/agent/cim-mvp/
├── graph.ts           # LangGraph StateGraph (7 stages)
├── state.ts           # CIM-specific state schema
├── tools.ts           # 15+ CIM tools
├── prompts.ts         # System prompts per stage (v3 HITL patterns)
├── knowledge-loader.ts # JSON knowledge file loader
└── index.ts           # Barrel exports
```

4. Keep the "Back to Feature Documentation" link at bottom
  </action>
  <verify>
README.md has:
- "Current (Authoritative)" section with cim-mvp/README.md link
- "Historical (Planning Reference)" section with _bmad-output/ links
- "Superseded" section noting original CIM implementation
- "Future Work" section noting Story 6.1
- "Key Files" section with code structure
- At least 70 lines
  </verify>
  <done>CIM Builder README updated with current/historical classification</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- [ ] docs/features/cim-builder/README.md has current/historical sections
- [ ] Production-ready status is documented
- [ ] Links in README are valid relative paths
- [ ] Future work (Story 6.1) is clearly noted
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- CIM Builder feature folder has clear current vs historical distinction
- Production-ready status (2026-01-14) is documented
- Requirements CIM-01 and CIM-02 satisfied
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/02-curate-feature-docs/02-03-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
