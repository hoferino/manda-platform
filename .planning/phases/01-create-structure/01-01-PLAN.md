<objective>
Create the docs/features/ directory structure with topic subfolders and READMEs.

Purpose: Establish the foundation for documentation consolidation - a clear home for feature documentation with explanatory READMEs that guide developers to the right place.

Output: Four README.md files - one top-level explaining the structure, and one in each topic subfolder (agent-v2, knowledge-graph, cim-builder) explaining what belongs there.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create directory structure and top-level README</name>
  <files>docs/features/README.md</files>
  <action>
Create the following directory structure:
```
docs/features/
  README.md
  agent-v2/
  knowledge-graph/
  cim-builder/
```

Write `docs/features/README.md` with:
- Title: "Feature Documentation"
- Brief explanation: this is the home for current feature planning docs
- Directory listing with links to each subfolder:
  - agent-v2/ - Agent system v2 documentation
  - knowledge-graph/ - Knowledge graph and Graphiti integration
  - cim-builder/ - CIM Builder workflow documentation
- Note that `_bmad-output/` contains historical planning docs (kept as reference)
- Note that core docs (manda-prd.md, manda-architecture.md) remain at docs/ root

Keep it concise - this is a navigation hub, not detailed documentation.
  </action>

`ls docs/features/` shows README.md, agent-v2/, knowledge-graph/, cim-builder/
`cat docs/features/README.md` shows structure with links to subfolders

  <name>Task 2: Create topic subfolder READMEs</name>
  <files>docs/features/agent-v2/README.md, docs/features/knowledge-graph/README.md, docs/features/cim-builder/README.md</files>
  <action>
Create README.md in each subfolder:

**docs/features/agent-v2/README.md:**
- Title: "Agent System v2"
- Brief description: LangGraph-based agent architecture with supervisor pattern
- Placeholder note: "Documentation will be consolidated here from _bmad-output/ and docs/"
- Link back to parent: `../README.md`

**docs/features/knowledge-graph/README.md:**
- Title: "Knowledge Graph"
- Brief description: Graphiti + Neo4j for entity extraction and semantic search
- Placeholder note: "Documentation will be consolidated here from _bmad-output/ and docs/"
- Link back to parent: `../README.md`

**docs/features/cim-builder/README.md:**
- Title: "CIM Builder"
- Brief description: Workflow for creating Confidential Information Memorandums
- Placeholder note: "Documentation will be consolidated here from _bmad-output/ and docs/"
- Link back to parent: `../README.md`

Each README should be ~15-20 lines. Keep descriptions factual based on CLAUDE.md context - these are placeholders that will be expanded in Phase 2.

After both tasks complete:

1. Directory structure exists:
```bash
ls -la docs/features/
ls -la docs/features/agent-v2/
ls -la docs/features/knowledge-graph/
ls -la docs/features/cim-builder/
```

2. All READMEs have content:
```bash
wc -l docs/features/README.md docs/features/*/README.md
```
Expected: Each file has 10+ lines

3. Links work (top-level README has relative links to subfolders)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- [ ] `docs/features/` directory exists
- [ ] Three subfolders exist: agent-v2/, knowledge-graph/, cim-builder/
- [ ] `docs/features/README.md` explains the structure and links to subfolders
- [ ] Each subfolder has a README.md explaining its purpose
- [ ] All READMEs are >10 lines with meaningful content

Requirements satisfied:
- STRUCT-01: Create `docs/features/` directory with subfolders
- STRUCT-02: Create `docs/features/README.md`
- STRUCT-03: Create README.md in each topic subfolder
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/01-create-structure/01-01-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
