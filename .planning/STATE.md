| 1 | Create Structure | Complete | 1/1 |
| 2 | Curate Feature Docs | In Progress | 1/? |
| 3 | Clean Core Docs | Pending | 0/0 |

## Accumulated Decisions

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 01-01 | Topic subfolders use existing feature naming | Consistency with CLAUDE.md (agent-v2, knowledge-graph, cim-builder) |
| 01-01 | Each README has placeholder for Phase 2 | Marks where content will be consolidated |
| 02-02 | Use 'Current (Authoritative)' for code locations | Code is source of truth for implementation |
| 02-02 | Use 'Historical (Planning Reference)' for planning artifacts | _bmad-output/ docs capture pre-implementation thinking |
| 02-02 | Document E10 migration context | Critical architectural decision (pgvector removal) needs visibility |
