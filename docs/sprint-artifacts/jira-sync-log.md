2. Access Jira project to view epics in board view
3. During sprint planning, create individual story issues under each epic
4. Update story status in Jira as development progresses
5. Use this sync-to-jira workflow again to sync new epics or update existing ones

## Notes

- BMAD epic files stored in: `docs/sprint-artifacts/epics/`
- Each epic file now contains Jira issue key for tracking
- Stories remain in master `docs/epics.md` for now
- Individual story files can be created as needed for detailed tracking
