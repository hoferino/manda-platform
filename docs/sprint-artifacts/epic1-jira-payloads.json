Each project is a completely isolated instance with its own data room, knowledge base, and deliverables.\n\nFunctional Requirements Covered:\n- FR-ARCH-001: Platform-Agent Separation\n- FR-ARCH-002: Tool-Based Agent Integration\n- FR-ARCH-003: Scalable Service Architecture\n\nUX Screens:\n- Projects Overview (Landing)\n- Project Workspace Shell\n- Top Navigation Bar\n- Sidebar Navigation\n\nTechnical Foundation:\n- Next.js 15 app structure (React 19.2, Turbopack beta)\n- Supabase Auth setup\n- PostgreSQL 18 schema (deals table)\n- RLS policies for data isolation\n- Docker Compose development environment\n\nAcceptance Criteria (Epic Level):\n- User can create new project with basic metadata\n- User can see all their projects in overview\n- User can switch between projects\n- Each project workspace shows project-specific data only\n- Data is completely isolated per project (RLS enforced)",
