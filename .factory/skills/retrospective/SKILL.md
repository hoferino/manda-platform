# Retrospective

## When to use
- After completing an epic or sprint.

## Steps
1. Load the relevant retrospective template or prior retros in `docs/sprint-artifacts/retrospectives/`.
2. Summarize outcomes: what went well, what to improve, actions, owners.
3. Capture decisions and tech debt via memory hook (`#decision:`, `#debt:`) into `.factory/memories.md`.
4. Update `docs/sprint-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml` if action items affect status.

## Checklist
- Ensure action items have owners and target dates.
- Link back to epics/stories affected.
