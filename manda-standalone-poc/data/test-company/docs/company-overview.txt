# TechCorp Inc. - Company Overview Document

## Company Background

**Founding Story**

TechCorp was founded in January 2015 by Jane Smith and John Doe, both former senior engineers at Google Cloud. Jane had spent 15 years at Google leading the Cloud AI infrastructure team, while John spent 12 years building Google's distributed systems architecture.

The founders identified a critical gap in the market: enterprise companies were struggling to deploy and manage AI models at scale. Existing solutions were either too complex for non-technical teams or too simplistic for enterprise needs.

They started TechCorp in a garage in Palo Alto with $500K of their own savings and a clear vision: make AI infrastructure as easy to use as turning on a light switch.
